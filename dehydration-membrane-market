At the rig, natural gases are nearly always saturated with water. When water-saturated natural gas flows in a pipeline the following problems can occur: Water can collect in pipelines and increase the pressure drop and/or cause slug flow. Water can freeze and/or form solid hydrates, consequently reducing the gas flow or plugging the line. Acid gases (H2S and CO2) dissolve in free water and will cause severe corrosion. Ideally dehydrating the gas by heating, chemical addition, solid desiccant and membrane dehydration mitigates these problems and improves safety.
